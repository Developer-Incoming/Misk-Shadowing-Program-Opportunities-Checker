# Misk's JSP Opportunities Availability Checker

For short it just sends GET requests to the site to get all information about the job shadowing, and then I just check whatever appeals to me so the code can check their availability instead, as automation is better, and also spending time coding is better than doing manual labor, I'm doing good for people who's after automation, I suppose.
