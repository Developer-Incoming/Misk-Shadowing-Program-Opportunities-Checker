# Misk's JSP Opportunities Availability Checker

For short it just sends GET requests to the site to get all information about the job shadowing, and then I just check whatever appeals to me so the code can check their availability instead, as automation is better, and also spending time coding is better than doing manual labor, I'm doing good for people who's after automation, I suppose.

Forgot to mention you need some built-in Python 3.11.3's modules, and an extenal library called [Keyboard](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/), to stop the program so it prints the logs if enabled, edit the code to your liking if you have trust issues or paranoid, we care less to some extent.


**Update: it worked and after over 12 hours of continuous request per second got an IT opportunity available, surprisingly it was only 1.**
